### Overview
Include overview here

Do you ever have a day off where you want to go do something but aren't sure what? Ever try to plan a day out but find the number of options leading to indecision? I find that sometimes when I try to plan fun days off or days out, the act of the planning becomes a bit tiring in itself, especially when you try to coordinate with another person's interests, and lessens the enjoyment I could be having--not to mention shortening the time we have available to go do the thing! Welcome to DODO.

DODO is a Day Off/Day Out activity and event scheduler that takes the decision-making off your shoulders and onto ours. When a user signs up for DODO they merely need to build their profile out by telling DODO where they live (or want to play) and what their general interests are, and DODO can begin generating a unique itinerary of activities and places to go so they can focus on getting the most out of their day! With the basic profile complete, any time a user wants to get out and explore their community, they can generate a New Schedule based on the specifics of the day! Weather a problem? Okay, lets stay indoors. Interested in art, a light lunch and refreshments nearby, for three people on a tight budget and you only have the afternoon? Great! DODO will give you a gallery or museum to visit along with a cafe, coffeehouse, or brewery nearby that fits your interests, timeframe, budget, and group size! With us, you can let your free time go the way of the DODO!
